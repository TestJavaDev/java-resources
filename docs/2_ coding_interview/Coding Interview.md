## Interview tasks

We would like you to build a simple key-secret store.

1. Let's keep it simple

Storage

Write a method that takes two parameters: a key and a secret.
Store them and return the given key.
- key:      f.e. "mY-cUsTom-kEy"
- secret:   f.e. "My secret no one should know!"
Constraint: key length <= 20

Retrieval

Write a method that takes one parameter: the key, and returns the stored secret.
- key:      f.e. "mY-cUsTom-kEy"
Constraint: key is case-insensitive
