## Backtracking Fundamentals

## Combinatorial search problems

Combinatorial search problems involve finding groupings and assignments of objects that satisfy certain conditions. Finding all permutations/subsets, solving sudoku, and 8-queens are classic combinatorial problems.

## Permutations
It’s important to review basic combinatorics to get an intuition for combinatorial problems.

Permutation means arranging things with an order. For example, permutations of [1, 2] are [1, 2] and [2, 1]. Permutations are best visualized with trees.

![back](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TestJavaDev/java-resources/master/resources/back/back1.png)

The number of permutations is given by n! (we looked at factorial in Recursion Review. The way to think about permutation is to imagine you have a bag of 3 letters. Initially, you have 3 letters to choose from, you pick one out of the bag. Now you are left with 2 letters. You pick again and now there’s only 1 letter. The total number of choices is 3*2*1 = 6, hence we have 6 leaf nodes in the tree above.

## Complexity
The complexity of combinatorial problems often grows rapidly with the size of the problem. For example, as we have seen, the number of permutations of 3 objects is only 6. However, the number of permutations of 10 objects is about 3 million. The number of permutations of 11 objects is about 40 million. The rapid growth of solution space with even a small increase in problem size is called combinatorial explosion.

## Combinatorial search: DFS on a tree
In combinatorial search problems, search space is in the shape of a tree. The tree that represents all the possible states is called a state-space tree.

Each node of the state-space tree represents a state we can reach in a combinatorial search (by making a particular combination). Leaf nodes are the solutions to the problem (permutations in the above example).

Combinatorial search problems boil down to DFS/backtracking on the state-space tree.

Since the search space can be quite large, we often have to “prune” the tree, i.e., discard branches.

## Three steps to conquer combinatorial search problems

We summarized a three-step system to solve combinatorial search problems:
1. Identify the state(s).
2. Draw the state-space tree.
3. DFS/backtrack on the state-space tree.

In step 1, we want to answer the following two questions to identify the states:
1. What state do we need to know whether we have reached a solution and can we use it to construct a solution if the problem asks for it? In the above permutation example, we need to keep track of the letters we have already selected when performing DFS.
2. What state do we need to decide which child nodes should be visited next and which ones should be pruned? In the above permutation example, we have to know what letters are left that can still be used, since each letter can only be used once.

For step 2, you want to draw the tree. A small test case that’s big enough to reach one solution (leaf node).

For step 3, apply the following backtracking template:

{% highlight java %}

def dfs(node, state):
    if state is a solution:
        report(state) # e.g. add state to final result list
        return

    for child in children:
        if child is a part of a potential solution:
            state.add(child) # make move
            dfs(child, state)
            state.remove(child) # backtrack
{% endhighlight %}

Notice how this is very similar to the ternary tree path code we’ve seen in DFS with States module. That problem has an explicit tree. For combinatorial search problems, we have to find our own tree.

All of this may sound very abstract at the moment, but it will become clear once we apply the system to a couple of real problems.

## Permutations

Given a list of unique letters, find all of its distinct permutations.

## Example
Input: ['a', 'b', 'c']

Output: [['a', 'b', 'c'], ['a', 'c', 'b'], ['b', 'a', 'c'], ['b', 'c', 'a'], ['c', 'a', 'b'], ['c', 'b', 'a']]

## Explanation

## Intuition
Classic combinatorial search problem. Let’s apply the 3-step system from the backtracking template.

## 1. Identify states
What state do we need to know whether we have reached a solution and can we use it to construct a solution if the problem asks for it?
1. We need a state to keep track of the list of letters we have chosen for the current permutation.

What state do we need to decide which child nodes should be visited next and which ones should be pruned?

2. We have to know what letters are left that can still be used, since each letter can only be used once.

## 2. Draw the state-space tree

![back](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TestJavaDev/java-resources/master/resources/back/back2.png)

3. DFS on the state-space tree#
Using the backtracking template as a basis, we add the two states we identified in step 1:

A path list to represent permutation constructed so far
A used list to record which letters are already used. used[i] == true means the ith letter in the original list has been used.
The time complexity is ![back](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TestJavaDev/java-resources/master/resources/back/back3.png)

{% highlight java %}

class Solution {
    public static List<List<Character>> permute(char[] letters) {
        List<List<Character>> res = new ArrayList<>();
        dfs(new ArrayList<>(), new boolean[letters.length], res, letters);
        return res;
    }

    private static void dfs(List<Character> path, boolean[] used, 
    List<List<Character>> res, char[] letters) {
        if (path.size() == used.length) {
            // make a deep copy since otherwise we'd be append 
            the same list over and over
            res.add(new ArrayList<Character>(path));
            return;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < used.length; i++) {
            // skip used letters
            if (used[i]) continue;
            // add letter to permutation, mark letter as used
            path.add(letters[i]);
            used[i] = true;
            dfs(path, used, res, letters);
            // remove letter from permutation, mark letter 
            as unused
            path.remove(path.size() - 1);
            used[i] = false;
        }
    }
         // Driver code  
	public static void main(String[] args) {

        String[] inputs = {"ab","abc"};
		for (int i = 0; i<inputs.length; i++) {
			System.out.println("Permutations : " + 
			Solution.permute(inputs[i].toCharArray()));
		}
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}

Notice how similar the solution is to Ternary Tree Paths. The only difference is that we have a new constraint: the “number of letters left” while deciding which subtree to go down to.

## Note on deep copy
In the exit logic of the above solution, we append a deep copy of the path res.append(path[:]). This creates a new list with elements being the same as current elements of path. Consider what happens if we don’t make the deep copy:

{% highlight java %}

res = []
path = []
for i in range(3):
    path.append(i)
    res.append(path)
print(res)
{% endhighlight %}

We get the same copy three times! Because append(path) actually appends a reference (memory address), we actually append the same list three times. path.append(i) mutates the list and affects all references to that list. To fix this, we create a new list before we append.

## Phone Number Letter Permutations

Given a phone number that contains digits from 2–9, find all possible letter combinations the phone number could translate to.

![back](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TestJavaDev/java-resources/master/resources/back/back4.png)

## Explanation
This is essentially asking for all permutations with the constraint of a number to letter mapping.

## 1. Identify state(s)
To construct a letter combination we need the letters we have selected so far.

To make a choice when we visit the current node’s children, we don’t need to maintain any additional state since the next possible letters are defined by the number to letter mapping.

## 2. Draw the tree

![back](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TestJavaDev/java-resources/master/resources/back/back5.png)

## 3. DFS on the tree
We traverse the state-space tree depth-first.

The time complexity is ![back](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TestJavaDev/java-resources/master/resources/back/back6.png)

{% highlight java %}

class Solution {
    private static final Map<Character, char[]> KEYBOARD = new HashMap<>();
    static {
        KEYBOARD.put('2', "abc".toCharArray());
        KEYBOARD.put('3', "def".toCharArray());
        KEYBOARD.put('4', "ghi".toCharArray());
        KEYBOARD.put('5', "jkl".toCharArray());
        KEYBOARD.put('6', "mno".toCharArray());
        KEYBOARD.put('7', "pqrs".toCharArray());
        KEYBOARD.put('8', "tuv".toCharArray());
        KEYBOARD.put('9', "wxyz".toCharArray());
    }
    public static List<String> letterCombinationsOfPhoneNumber(String digits) {
        List<String> res = new ArrayList<>();
        dfs(new StringBuilder(), res, digits.toCharArray());
        return res;
    }
    private static void dfs(StringBuilder path, List<String> res, 
    char[] digits) {
        if (path.length() == digits.length) {
            res.add(path.toString());
            return;
        }
        char next_digit = digits[path.length()];
        for (char letter : KEYBOARD.get(next_digit)) {
            path.append(letter);
            dfs(path, res, digits);
            path.deleteCharAt(path.length() - 1);
        }
    }
    // Driver code  
	public static void main(String[] args) {
        String[] inputs = {"56", "23", "235"};
        for(int i = 0; i < inputs.length; i++) {
            System.out.println("Letter combinations of phone number : " + 
            Solution.letterCombinationsOfPhoneNumber(inputs[i]));
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Memoization

Memoization is a fancy word for a simple concept as is the case for a lot of things we learn at school. It means saving the previous function call results in a dictionary and reading from it when we do the exact same call again. And no, it is not spelled incorrectly. The word is meant to mean writing down on a “memo”.

A classic example is calculating the Fibonacci numbers.
{% highlight java %}
class Solution {
     public static int fib(int n) {
        if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
            return n;
        }
        return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
    }
    public static void main( String args[] ) {
        System.out.println( fib(10) );
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

![back](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TestJavaDev/java-resources/master/resources/back/back7.png)
![back](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TestJavaDev/java-resources/master/resources/back/back8.png)
![back](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TestJavaDev/java-resources/master/resources/back/back9.png)

The solution is simply saving previous results in a map of function arguments to results (the “memo”), checking it, and returning previous results if it has been done before. Otherwise, we carry out the computation and save the results in the map.
{% highlight java %}
class Solution {
    public static int fib(int n, int[] memo) {
        // check in memo, if found, retrieve and return right away
        if (memo[n] != 0 && memo.length < n) return memo[n];

        if (n == 0 || n == 1) return n;

        int res = fib(n - 1, memo) + fib(n - 2, memo);

        // save result to memo before returning
        memo[n] = res;
        return res;
    }
    public static void main( String args[] ) {
        int[] memo = new int[100];
        System.out.println( fib(0, memo));
        System.out.println( fib(1, memo));
        System.out.println( fib(2, memo));
        System.out.println( fib(3, memo));
        System.out.println( fib(10, memo));
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Memoization is particularly useful for combinatorial problems that have large repeated state-space tree branches.

## Word Break

Given a string and a list of words, determine if the string can be constructed from concatenating words from the list of words. A word can be used multiple times.

Input:

s = "educativeio"

words = ["educative", "io"]

Output: true

Input:

s = "aab"

words = ["a", "c"]

Output: false

## Explanation
This is yet another combinatorial search problem. Let’s apply the three-step backtracking system:

## 1. Identify the states
To determine whether we have completely constructed the target string s, we have to find:
1. The characters that are left to be matched using words in the list.

To make a choice when we visit the current node’s children, we don’t need any additional states since we can use any word in the list an unlimited number of times

## 2. Draw the space-state tree

![back](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TestJavaDev/java-resources/master/resources/back/back10.png)

Note that in the above figure, there are two paths that lead to an empty string, i.e., completely matching target. When we DFS, we would reach the left one first without visiting the other one since we just need one successful path to return true.

## 3. DFS on the space-state tree
Using the backtracking template as a basis, we add the state we identified in step 1:
1. We use index i to record the current position in the target we have matched so far. s[:i] is matched and s[i:] is to be matched.
{% highlight java %}
class Solution {
    public static boolean wordBreak(String s, String[] words) {
        return dfs(0, s, words);
    }

    private static boolean dfs(int i, String s, String[] words) {
        // we have constructed the entire target s
        if (i == s.length()) return true;

        for (String word : words) {
            // check if this a valid path
            if (s.substring(i).startsWith(word)) {
                // any path leads to true is fine
                if (dfs(i + word.length(), s, words)) return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    // Driver code  
	public static void main(String[] args) {

	    String[] inputs = {"algomonster", "aab", "aaaaab"};
        String[] inputs2 = {"algo monster", "a c", 
        "a aa aaa aaaa aaaaa aaaaaa aaaaaaa aaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaa"};

		for (int i = 0; i<inputs.length; i++) {
			System.out.println("Word break : " + Solution.wordBreak(inputs[i],
			 inputs2[i].split(" ")));
		}
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Memoization
Everything looks great. When we finish typing that last bracket/semicolon, we can almost hear angels singing and all tests passing.

Except there is one pesty test case:
![back](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TestJavaDev/java-resources/master/resources/back/back11.png)

Why does this one time out? We have 10 branches to check each level of the tree. There are 140 as in the target and in the worst case, we’d be looking at 10^140 branches. Remember we talked about “combinatorial explosion” in the backtracking module. We have just been struck by it. The way to solve this is to use memoization to cache the branches we have already seen. We can even see duplicates in the above example.
![back](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TestJavaDev/java-resources/master/resources/back/back12.png)

{% highlight java %}
class Solution {
    public static boolean wordBreak(String s, String[] words) {
        return dfs(0, new Boolean[s.length()], s, words);
    }

    private static boolean dfs(int i, Boolean[] memo, String s, String[] words) {
        if (i == s.length()) return true;

        if (memo[i] != null) return memo[i];

        boolean ok = false;
        for (String word : words) {
            if (s.substring(i).startsWith(word)) {
                ok = ok || dfs(i + word.length(), memo, s, words);
            }
        }
        memo[i] = ok;
        return ok;
    }
    // Driver code  
	public static void main(String[] args) {

	    String[] inputs = {"algomonster", "aab", 
	    "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
	    aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
	    aaaaaab"};
        String[] inputs2 = {"algo monster", "a c", "a aa aaa aaaa aaaaa aaaaaa
         aaaaaaa aaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaa"};

		for (int i = 0; i<inputs.length; i++) {
			System.out.println("Word break : " + Solution.wordBreak(inputs[i],
			 inputs2[i].split(" ")));
		}
	}
}

## Decode String

## Problem statement

We have a message to decode. Letters are encoded to digits by their position in the alphabet:
![back](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TestJavaDev/java-resources/master/resources/back/back13.png)

Given a non-empty string of digits, how many ways are there to decode it?

## Example 1
Input: "18"

Output: 2

Explanation: "18" can be decoded as "AH" or "R"

## Example 2
Input: "123"

Output: 3

Explanation: "123" can be decoded as "ABC", "LC", "AW"

## Explanation
This is a combinatorial search problem so we apply the three-step system:

## 1. Identify states
What state do we need to know whether we have decoded a string?

We can keep track of the number of digits we have already matched in index i. When i == length of digits, we have finished.
What state do we need to decide which child nodes of the state-space tree should be visited next?

Since there’s no constraint on which letters can be used for decoding, we don’t need any state here.

## 2. Draw the space-state tree
![back](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TestJavaDev/java-resources/master/resources/back/back14.png)

## 3. DFS
Using the backtracking template as a basis, we add the state we identified in step 1:
1. i for the number of digits we have already matched.

DFS returns the number of ways we can decode digits[i:].

{% highlight java %}
class Solution {

    private static final List<String> LETTERS = 
    IntStream.range(1, 27).mapToObj(Integer::toString)
    .collect(Collectors.toList());

    public static int countDecodeWays(String digits) {
        return dfs(0, digits);
    }

    private static int dfs(int i, String digits) {
        if (i == digits.length()) return 1;

        int ways = 0;
        String remaining = digits.substring(i);
        for (String prefix : LETTERS) {
            if (remaining.startsWith(prefix)) {
                ways += dfs(i + prefix.length(), digits);
            }
        }
            return ways;
    }
    // Driver code  
	public static void main(String[] args) {

        String[] inputs = {"12", "123", "11223"};
		for (int i = 0; i<inputs.length; i++) {
			System.out.println("Decode ways : " + 
			Solution.countDecodeWays(inputs[i]));
		}
	}
}

Again, we see there are overlapping subproblems.
