## Overview of Linear & Non-Linear Data Structures

## Linear Data Structures
In linear data structures, each element is connected to either one (the next element) or two (the next and previous) more elements. Traversal in these structures is linear, meaning that insertion, deletion, and search work in O(n).

Arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues are all example of linear data structures.

## Non-Linear Data Structures
The exact opposite of linear data structures are non-linear data structures. In a non-linear data structure, each element can be connected to several other data elements. Traversal is not linear; hence, search, insertion, and deletion can work in O(log n) and even O(1) time.

Trees, graphs and hash tables are all non-linear data structures.

## Time and Space Complexity Cheat Table
Here’s a quick refresher of all the complexities for the data structures we’ve studied in this course. This will help you compare their performances in different scenarios.

Note: In the table, n is the total number of elements stored in the structure.
